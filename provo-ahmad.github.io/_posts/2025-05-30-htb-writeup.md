## Summary

This is a quick walkthrough of **HTB - Mischief**. It was a fun web challenge with some tricky logic bugs.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN scan.txt 10.10.11.124
```

Found port `80`, did Gobuster:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.124 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

Got reverse shell via PHP upload â†’ privilege escalation via sudo misconfiguration.
