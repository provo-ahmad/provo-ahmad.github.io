# Minimal Mistakes theme requires Jekyll 4.x+
gem "jekyll", "~> 4.3"

# Add other plugins that Minimal Mistakes might rely on,
# or that you explicitly want. Minimal Mistakes often uses:
gem "jekyll-seo-tag"
gem "jekyll-sitemap" # Good to have for SEO
gem "jekyll-feed"    # You had this in _config.yml
gem "jekyll-paginate" # You had this in _config.yml
# You may also want to explicitly add jekyll-remote-theme if it's not automatically included
gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
